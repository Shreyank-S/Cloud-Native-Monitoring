CLOUD NATIVE MONITORING

Developed a Cloud Native Monitoring Application designed to provide real-time insights into the health and performance of cloud-deployed applications. The application monitors key metrics like CPU usage and memory consumption, enabling users to detect performance bottlenecks and ensure system reliability."

Technologies Used:
"This project leverages a modern cloud-native stack:
* Built using HTML and CSS for the user interface.
* Used Python "psutil" to fetch CPU and Memory metrics
* Containerization: Docker was used to containerize the monitoring components, ensuring portability and scalability."**
* Cloud Platform: Created the image using Docker and pushed the image to Amazon ECR service.
